# MATLAB example guide

This README will guide you through the setup process as well as how to run the different examples.

## Requirements

The code is written and tested on MATLAB R2024a, but it should work with older versions of MATLAB.

## Setup and how to run an example

To run the examples you simply run the scripts inside of the Examples folder.

The examples use the class `Engine` to simplify and automate the process of configure the different test. Feel free to tweak and customize the engine to your liking.
